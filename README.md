# DbEngine version 1.0
DbEngine is a software created by the interns at Sapient Razorfish in order to replicate how a database works and retrieve data. Following are the steps to use it :
1. It asks for a query.
2. Type it.
3. Fire it.
4. And you get the desired result.
5. Simple as that

Thanks for using.
